# Chile_economic_indicators

This notebook simulates a real case of extracting, cleaning and displaying certain economic indicators. 
All the data that includes this repository is extracted via API of the Chilean Central Bank (BCCh).

The main Jupyter Notebook of this repository works as a Guide or Procedure and by pressing the corresponding cells you can check what was written to accomplish what you are seeing.

On the other hand, the repository also has the main diagram for the extraction by OOP and the two .py asociated with the process of scrap and plot the selected data available. Additionally, the sqlite module is applied by saving the data extracted from the API into a database in order to avoid over scrapping the same data.
